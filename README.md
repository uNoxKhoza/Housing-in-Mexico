About the Project

This project analyzes a dataset of 21,000 properties listed for sale in Mexico from the real estate website Properati.com. The primary objective is to determine whether the sale prices of these properties are influenced more by the property size or by the location.

Through this project, you'll gain experience with:

    Organizing Data: Using basic Python data structures to manage and structure information.
    Data Import and Cleaning: Loading data from CSV files and cleaning it with the pandas library to prepare for analysis.
    Data Visualization: Creating informative visuals, such as scatter and box plots, to better understand the data distribution and trends.
    Analyzing Variable Relationships: Examining the correlation between property size, location, and sale price to draw meaningful insights.
